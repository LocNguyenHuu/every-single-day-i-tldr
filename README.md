- http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/injection.html An old post of Martin Fowler I've never read. IoC => Dependency Injection. An "assembler": the service that fulfill dependencies. 3 types of IoC: Interface Injection, Setter Injection, Constructor Injection. Another pattern is the Service Locator (basically, a class Registry (singleton or not) where you load or ask for an implementation). Both patterns can be mixed. With the Locator, every classes needs a reference to a Locator. With IoC, there is no such thing, it's completely invisible. XML sucks.
- http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html Dummy: just used to fulfill params. Fake: A fully functional alternative, not suitable for prod (eg: an in-memory db). Stub: just some methods are set to return something. Mock: used to verify methods have been called (.expected.to.be.called.once), and can set the result.

- https://rainsoft.io/what-every-javascript-developer-should-know-about-unicode/ : Unicode 9: 128172 characters, Domain: Codepoint, Planes, Code unit, Character name, Astract Symbol, Surrogate Pairs, Encoding, GraphÃ¨me, Symbol, Glyph, Combining Mark. In JS: .length = nb of code units (surrogate pairs = 2cu, so it's just wrong), "\u0020" in JS. For astral (>0xFFFF) use surrogate pairs = 2 code points (\u*2) or \u{12345} in ES6. String normalization (because multiple way to represent a same symbol, need a canonical form). JS: str.normalize(). [...str] or Array.from(str) (@@iterator) has the good length (deal with unicode and surrogates) (str.length = 5 but [...str].length = 4). str.codePointAt(index). String.fromCodePoint(cp). If used in regexes, use /.../u otherwise it sucks and fails.
