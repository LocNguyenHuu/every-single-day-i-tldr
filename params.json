IoC => Dependency Injection. An \"assembler\": the service that fulfill dependencies. 3 types of IoC: Interface Injection, Setter Injection, Constructor Injection. Another pattern is the Service Locator (basically, a class Registry (singleton or not) where you load or ask for an implementation). Both patterns can be mixed. With the Locator, every classes needs a reference to a Locator. With IoC, there is no such thing, it's completely invisible. XML sucks.\r\n- http://www.martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html Dummy: just used to fulfill params. Fake: A fully functional alternative, not suitable for prod (eg: an in-memory db).
